This project aims to make your life a lot easier by automatically generating structs for a given JSON. 

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/marhaupe/json2struct
```

## Usage

### Base command:
Calling `json2struct` without arguments opens the superior text editor for unix systems, vim ðŸ¤–. Insert the JSON data you want to parse and save and exit - in case you always forget how to do that: `:wq!`.

### Flags:
Call `json2struct -s` or `json2struct --string` with the JSON data as argument. 

```bash
 json2struct -s "$(curl "https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2")"
```

The `string` option lets you pipe JSON data as input. The current implementation lacks some features, e.g. you need to escape quotes manually. PR's are more than welcome.
