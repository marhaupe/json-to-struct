This projects aims to make your life a lot easier by automatically generating structs for a given JSON. 

## Installing

```bash
go get github.com/marhaupe/json2struct
```

## Usage

### No additional commands:
Call `json2struct` with the JSON string as an argument. 

```bash
 json2struct "$(curl "https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2")"
```

This option lets you pipe JSONs as input, but does not handle inputting JSONs directly very well since you need to escape quotes and stuff like that.

### Command `create`:
Calling `json2struct create` opens the superior text editor for unix systems, vim ðŸ¤–. Write the JSON you want to parse in there and save and exit - just in case you get stuck: `:wq!`. 

## Lastly

Please feel free to open pull requests for features you miss, stuff that doesn't work, the usual.
